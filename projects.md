* **Re-Entry Impactathon** We are bringing together diverse stakeholders including
technologists, designers, social service staff and re-entering citizens to share skills,
strategies, and experience
* **Illinois Re-Entry Guide Initiative** Chi Hack Night Access to Justice team is
helping EJP apply UX/design principles to its [re-entry guide](http://www.educationjustice.net/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Re-entry-Guide-2015_2016_Updated-May-2016_FINAL_nocrops.pdf)
and convert it into an online platform for expanding its accessibility and reach,
as well as reducing its printing costs. We hope to build it in an open source
format allowing other states to adapt and reuse the tool.
